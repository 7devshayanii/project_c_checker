        <h3>⚠️ Hey, Quick Heads Up!</h3>
        <p><strong>Before you start mixing and matching, here's what you should know:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>This is just a helper tool:</strong> Think of this as a friendly guide, not your dermatologist. Always check with a real skincare pro before trying new combinations!</li>
            <li><strong>We're working with what we know:</strong> Our database has common conflicts, but we can't know everything. New research comes out all the time!</li>
            <li><strong>Spelling counts:</strong> Make sure you type ingredient names correctly (like "Retinol" not "Retinool"). If it's misspelled, we won't catch potential issues.</li>
            <li><strong>No conflicts doesn't mean totally safe:</strong> Just because we didn't find a conflict doesn't mean it's 100% safe for YOUR skin. Everyone's different!</li>
            <li><strong>Talk to the experts:</strong> Seriously, chat with a dermatologist or skincare professional, especially if you have sensitive skin or any skin conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Use at your own risk:</strong> We can't be held responsible if something goes wrong. This tool is meant to help, but it's not the final word.</li>
            <li><strong>Do your homework:</strong> Use this as a starting point, then dig deeper with trusted sources and professional advice.</li>
